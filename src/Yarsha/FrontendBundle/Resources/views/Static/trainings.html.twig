            <p style="text-align:justify;">The literal function of training is to produce change. It is the upgrading of an individualâ€™s skill or
                the addition of a new skill, which in turn can bring about the desired change an organization is
                seeking. It is important to understand that training in and of itself cannot motivate a work force.
                However, it is an essential part of what is needed to accomplish the long-term goals of the agency. In
                addition to the trainings, it is important to identify the appropriate medium of motivation to appraise
                the performance. Kantipur Management provides wide range of trainings focused on corporate world and
